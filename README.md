# ðŸŽ² Dice Roller App

A simple Flutter app to roll a dice â€” built as part of a course I'm currently taking to learn Flutter fundamentals.

This app is basically just:  
ðŸ‘‰ Press a button â†’ dice rolls with animation â†’ random result shows up ðŸ˜„

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Press a button to roll the dice  
- Dice number is randomized between 1â€“6  
- Fun little animation simulates the rolling effect

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Flutter** for building the UI  
- **Dart** for the logic and animation  
- **Timer & Random** for simulating the dice roll

## ðŸ“š Why I Built This

I built this app as a hands-on exercise from a Flutter course Iâ€™m currently learning. Itâ€™s a simple project with a single feature â€” rolling a dice â€” but it helped me understand:

- How to use `StatefulWidget`  
- How to update UI with `setState`  
- How to animate using `Timer.periodic`  
- How to load images dynamically in Flutter

## ðŸ–¼ Dice Assets

Dice images (`dice_1.png` to `dice_6.png`) are placed inside the `/assets` folder.  
Make sure to declare them in `pubspec.yaml` like this:

```yaml
flutter:
  images:
    - images/dice1.png
    - images/dice2.png
    - images/dice3.png
    - images/dice4.png
    - images/dice5.png
    - images/dice6.png
```

## ðŸ™ƒ Just for Fun
This app has no real purpose other than to help me learn.
But hey, if you ever need to roll a dice and donâ€™t have a real one... you're covered ðŸŽ‰
